# Hello!

I'm a product manager working in the research and analytics space.

Most recently I led the development process for a new product from idea to launch called Advertising Analytics.

Advertising Analytics deploys synthetic viewers to ad-supported streaming services and analyzes the ads across the industry.
* Synthetic viewers algorithmically select content based on demographic preferences and content popularity
* Each viewer watches in timed blocks
* For each title viewed, every ad is noted and analyzed using human-in-the-loop LLMs to classify the brands and products
* The product automatically timestamps ads for quantitative analysis including ads per hour, ads per break, etc.
* The data is rolled into a dashboard product used by global streaming studios.

I have a particular passion for health tech serving individuals directly, rather than selling directly to providers. There are a ton of ignored opportunities in the space.

If you'd like to get in touch, please do!
