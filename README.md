Hello!

I'm a Product Manager for Ampere Analysis, a market research and data analytics firm.

I manage data products so a lot of my work involves working with developers and data engineers as well as with data analysts and sales teams.

Some of my favorite aspects of product management:
* Working with technical teams to collaborate across groups and infrastructures
* Interfacing with early adopters and prospective customers to validate and steer development in the right direction
* Collaborating across many functions to bring a product to market

Communication is one of the most important parts of product management and there aren't many replacements for a human to human conversation. But there are also some tools I find really helpful:
* [Linear](https://linear.app/docs) for transparency, leadership communication, async work, roadmapping, and documentation. The triage tool is a great way to systematically take in customer feedback.
* [GitHub](https://github.com) for developers - integrated with Linear (seeing a pull request on issue completion tickles my brain)
* [Cursor](https://www.cursor.com) as an IDE - super easy way to load and search library docs, choose any model for a copilot (although - GitHub just introduced this too), and search the web with the LLM of your choice
* [Perplexity](https://www.perplexity.ai) for accelerated market research to analyze product fit

A couple of my favorite outcomes at Ampere:
* Ad Analytics (launching Q1 2025) tracks advertising on streaming services and uses LLMs to identify the brands and products that appear.
* Global Streaming Models: forecasts of global ad revenue, using integrated market data to show clients over 15 new KPIs and owned across the entire team.

I also love learning and exploring my own ideas with a particular degree of excitement about automation, data, and AI.
