Hello!

I'm a Research Manager for Ampere Analysis, a market research and data analytics firm.

I work as a product manager and data analyst, so a lot of my work involves data modeling, forecasting and data analytics.

Most of my day-to-day involves Python, SQL, and product management work around building marketable data products.

I love learning and exploring my own ideas with a particular degree of excitement about automation, data, and AI.
